// ide-discovery.ts — Watches ~/.claude/ide/ for IDE lockfiles.
//
// Responsibilities (DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03):
//   - Initial scan + `fs.watch` for add/modify/delete of `*.lock` files.
//   - Parse each lockfile, prune those with a non-alive PID.
//   - Emit typed events on `companionBus`: ide:added, ide:changed, ide:removed.
//   - Low-frequency rescan (10s) catches PID-death that fs.watch never notifies
//     us about.
//   - Tolerate a missing ideDir (the Claude CLI creates it lazily).
//   - Tolerate malformed lockfile JSON (skip silently; watcher stays alive).
//
// `authToken` is kept in memory only; never persisted. Callers that need
// it (ws-bridge bind path) snapshot it out of `listAvailableIdes()` at
// bind time.
//
// This module is a singleton — `startIdeDiscovery()` enforces one active
// watcher at a time. `resetIdeDiscoveryForTests()` clears internal state
// for test isolation.
